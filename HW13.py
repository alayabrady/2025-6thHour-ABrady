#A common exercise in computer science is "FizzBuzz". The rules of
#the game are simple. Count from 1 to 100 but with every number that
#is divisible by 3 you say "Fizz" instead of the number,
#every number divisible by 5 you say "Buzz" instead,
#and if it's divisible by both you say "FizzBuzz".

#Create a while loop that follows the rules of the game.

a=1
while a <= 100:

    if a%3==0 and a%5==0:
        print("fizzbuzz")
    elif a%3==0:
        print("fizz")
    elif a%5==0:
        print("buzz")
    else:
        print(a)
    a+=1
