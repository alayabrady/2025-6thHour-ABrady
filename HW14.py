#1. Create a for loop with variable i that counts down from 5 to 1 and then prints "Hello World!"
#at the end.
for i in range(5,0,-1):
    print(i)
else:
    print("hello world!")

#2. Create a for loop that counts up and prints only even numbers between 1 and 30.
for a in range(1,31):
    if a % 2 == 0:
        print(a)

#3. Create a for loop that prints from 1 to 30 and continues (skips the number) if the number is
#divisible by 3.
for r in range(1,31):
    if r % 3 != 0:
        print(r)

#4. Create a for loop that prints 5 different animals from a list.
animals=['cottontail','jackrabbit','rabbit',"holland lop", "bunny"]
for a in animals:
    print(a)

#5. Create a for loop that spells out a word you input backwards.
#(HINT: Google "How to reverse a string in Python")
for d in input("give me a word:")[::-1]:
    print(d)

#6. Create a list containing 10 integers of your choice and print the list.
numlist = [6,7,67,670,6.7,607,6700,67000,670000,6700000]
print(numlist)
#7. Create two empty variables named evenNumbers and oddNumbers.
evennumber = 0
oddnumber = 0
#8. Make a loop that counts the number of even and odd numbers in the list, and prints the
#result after the loop# .
for item in numlist:
    if item % 2 == 0:
        evennumber += 1
    if item % 3 == 0:
        oddnumber += 1
#9. Create a variable that asks the user for an integer and an empty integer variable.
num = 1

x = int(input("enter a number:"))
#10. Create a loop with a range from 1 to the number the user input. Use the loop to find the
#factorial of that number and print the result. A factorial of a number is that number multiplied
#by every number before it until you reach 1. (For example: 5! is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120)
for i in range(1,x+1):
    num *= i

print(num)
