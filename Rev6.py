#1. Create a def function that prints out "Hello World!". Call the function.

def hello_world():
    print("Hello World!")
hello_world()

#2. Create a def function that prints your name. Call the function with the name as the argument.

def name(your_name):
    print(your_name)
name("alaya")

#3. Create a def function that calculates the average of a list. Call the function with the list as the argument.

def average_list(list):
    print(sum(list) / len(list))
average_list([1,2,3,4,5])

#4. Call the function from #3 but with a new list of different numbers.

average_list([7, 8, 9, 10, 11])

#5. Create a def function that takes two numbers as arguments, x and y. Inside the function, create a for loop
#with a range of 10. Inside the loop, print x, make z equal the sum of x and y, make x equal y, then y equal z.

def xny (x,y):
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(x)
        z = x + y
        x = y
        y = z

#6. Call the function from #5 with the arguments for x and y being 0 and 1.

xny(0,1)
