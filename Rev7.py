#2. Make a def function within the class that adds 1 to the grade attribute to any object called to it.
#If they are 12th grade, have the code change their grade to "graduated" instead.

    def addone(self):
        if self.grade == 12:
            print("They have graduated!")
        else:
            self.grade +=1
